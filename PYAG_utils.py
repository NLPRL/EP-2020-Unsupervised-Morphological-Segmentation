Takes a morph tree such as:

'''
This function parses the output of the segmented_word morphologies into
a human-readable format that denotes a segmented_word split into its morphemes
separated by a <separate_segments_by> character and converting hex denoted characters
into their respective unicode symbol. It writes these conversions
into 2 files: one file contains only the word segmentations, the other contains
the segmentation along with its respective word.

:param file: a txt file that contains each words' morphology trees
:param min_stem_length: integer that represents the minimum length of a
Stem morph in characters
:param nonterminals_to_parse: a string that denotes the nontermials and the order that will
be parsed and returned in the final output
:param segmented_text_file: file location to write all word segmentations
:param segmented_dictionary_file: file location to write all word segmentations
and their respective word
:return map of words and their respective parsings by affix
(example: "irreplaceables" : "ir+re+(place)+able+s")
