The 'Data' folder contains all the relevant data for the project.
The 'Outputs' folder is used as a master directory to store all the outputs generated by our setup.



All the other files are related to the code for the project.

Some of the code used in the project has been adapted from 'https://github.com/rnd2110/MorphAGram', however
 some of the functions have been extensively tweaked and modified for personal convenience, so no guarantee
 howsoever is provided that these functions provide the same usage as the author originally planned to.

The code is well commented, and anyone with a basic idea about the setup should be able to grasp the workflow.

Rest all code (~1500 lines of code) is completely generated by me.

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Build the pycfg binary
2. Run the 'app.py' file with **python2.7**
	(Note: app.py is a pyqt4 based GUI app, the app runs into compatibility problems with other versions of python)
	the command in Debian systems should be:
	'python2.7 app.py'
3. This will launch an easy-to-use Graphical Application, which automates most of the processes.
