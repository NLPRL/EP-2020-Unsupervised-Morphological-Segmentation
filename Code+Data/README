--------
Folders
--------

The 'Data' folder contains all the relevant data for the project (Test and Training data, Grammars).

The 'Outputs' folder is used as a master directory to store all the outputs generated by our setup.


-----
Code
-----

All the other files are related to the code for the project.

The combined Code length exceeds ~2000 lines.
The code is well commented, and anyone with a basic idea about the setup should be able to grasp the workflow.

## Some of the code used in the project has been adapted from 'https://github.com/rnd2110/MorphAGram'.
**However, some of the functions/methods have been extensively tweaked and modified for personal convenience, so no 
 guarantee howsoever is provided that these methods perform the same function as the author originally planned.**

*Rest all code (~1500 lines of code) is completely generated by me.*

-----------
HOW TO USE:
-----------

1. Build the pycfg binary.

2. Run the 'app.py' file with **python2.7** (app.py is a pyqt4 based GUI app, the app runs into compatibility issues
 with other versions of python; at least for me it only works on python2.7).
   The terminal command on Ubuntu should be:
	'python2.7 app.py'

3. This should launch an easy-to-use Graphical Interface based Application, which automates most of the processes
 described in the report.

NOTE: If the app is closed in between the Training Phase (i.e., before the Training Phase is complete), the process
 running on the pycfg binary is not killed. Either the pycfg process should be manually killed, or the correct way
 to stop the training (on Ubuntu) is to press 'Ctrl + C' in the terminal which is running the app.
