All the data and all the code used in the project is provided herewith.
To understand the working of setup refer to the report, provided herewith.

1. The code has been tested and used on Debian based Linux distribution Ubuntu (and should produce results similar to
 those shown in report under normal circumstances).
2. All the extra files (output results, temporary files) have been deleted, so a fresh setup is being provided here.
3. The details of the code are given in the README corresponding to the 'Code+Data' folder.


The evaluation folder consists of the metrics used to evaluate the results, run the python script files for more info.
e.g., 'python BPR.py' from the terminal

The py-cfg folder contains the Adaptor Grammar framework by Mark Johnson. The copy provided herewith is a fresh copy
 from the official source. The makefile needs to be run to generate the relevant files and binaries on your PC.
 for Debian based Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu), just the 'make' command from the terminal will do
 (for more info, refer to README by Mark Johnson in the folder)
